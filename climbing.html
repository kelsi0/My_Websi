                    <li>Competitive Climbing Experience</li>
                        <p>During my youth, I gained experience climbing competitively both indoors and outdoors. I began
                        climbing at age seven in the south of France and started competing in departmental and regional
                        competitions from 2009 to 2013. While training for these competitions I was fortunate enough to
                        experience both indoor walls and outdoor routes. In 2013, I moved to Exeter, UK, and joined a squad
                        training for BMC competitions but was unable to continue due to the progression of my disability. I am
                        currently trying entirely new methods of climbing but I am sure I will make a return to competitive
                        climbing in the near future.</p>

                    <li>Teaching Climbing</li>
                        <p>As a part of my training for the climbing competitions I supported my climbing instructors in both
                            teaching and supervising the younger climbers. This has given me a great basis to be abe to teach
                            newcomers to the sport. More recently I have been introducing my friends to bouldering and
                            auto-belay climbing and instructing them each week. I began teaching correct belay technique and
                            have taught one of my friends who is now confident in belaying me without supervision.</p>

                    <li>CWI Qualification Route</li>
                        <p>As part of my continual development plan I am currently focusing on passing my CWI as it will allow
                            me to continue competing and teaching. As a current member of the BMC I am awaiting a safe time
                            to book the training sessions, unfortunately, these have been delayed numerous times due to the
                            ongoing pandemic. In the meantime, I have dedicated myself to familiarising myself with various
                            teaching techniques by shadowing climbing trainersâ€™ sessions and gaining more experience with
                            para-climbing techniques.</p>
