            <div class="mainText"><p>After a hiatus due to health issues, I am currently seeking opportunities to enter full-time employment in a
                rewarding career which will allow me to improve and utilise the skill set I have built throughout my academic
                and employment life. While the first two years of my university experience were a bigger challenge than I
                originally anticipated, due to being diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I overcame these challenges
                and graduated with a 2:1 degree in Musical Arts from the University of Salford. A year after my graduation, I
                was partnered with my Canine Partner, Hamble, which provided the boost to my confidence and health that
                I needed to secure a part-time position within ASDAâ€™s customer service team. This role allowed me to
                understand and increase both my capacities and limitations within my working-life. I believe that the skills I
                have built over this time has positioned me perfectly to transition to a new career. Throughout university
                years, I gained skills such as document drafting and manipulation. Meanwhile my employment roles in
                various customer-facing roles has allowed me to gain confidence conversing with customers and clients. I
                am now looking to take the first step in utilising these skills to build a career .</p></div>
