                <!-- I will put a brief description of my musical history here. -->
                <p>In July 2018, I graduted with a 2:1 Musical Arts degree from Salford University. I had began my musical journey with piano lessons as a child and then choosing to study music further at BTEC and finally degree level. 
                Having started with classical piano, I originally found the transition into pop vocals difficult but after learning to play guitar and accompany myself I began to find my own voice. At the start of my degree, I continued to develop my voice and music theory when I fell ill and was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This severly impacted my studies until my final year when I switched to the Musical Arts degree and focused on vocal and clarinet performance and composition. I found the strength in my voice and then how to develop and control it. 
                After graduating, I began teaching piano to ages 6 to 80 as my customer base was growing the covid-19 pandemic hit and I was forced to stop.
                Currently, I am working on my own songs and my first EP in my free time while I focus on finding my feet and building a career in IT.</p>
